# sensulib

Base library for writing go checks.

## Goals

There are three goals for this project:

1. write a go library to help writing go check plugins.
2. provide a [magefile](https://magefile.org/) library to help publishing assets for Sensu-go.

## Legal

This project is licensed under [Blue Oak Model License v1.0.0](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0). It is not registered either at OSI or GNU, therefore GitHub is widely looking at the other direction. However, this is the license I'm most happy with: you can read and understand it with no legal degree, and there are no hidden or cryptic meanings in it.

The project is also governed with [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/)'s [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/) in mind. I'm not copying it here, as a pledge for taking the verbatim version by the word, and we are not going to modify it in any way.

## Any issues?

Open a ticket, perhaps a pull request. We support [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). You might want to [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this project first.
